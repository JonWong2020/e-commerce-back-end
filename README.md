  ## Description
  An application that allows you to interact with a database by providing url-based API routes that will allow you to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`/`Update`, and `DELETE` data within the database.  This application is not deployed and serves more as a concept of how back-end servers function.
  
  ## Usage
  To use the applicaiton you can clone the repository.  Once cloned, you will needs Node.js installed as well to run the commands in the CLI, (Command Line Inteface), of your console's terminal.  To start the application you can run `node index.js` or `npm run start` in the console and a series of prompts will appear for you to choose depending on what you would like to do.  A demo video of how the application works can be found in the `Links` section next to the tab labeled `App Demo`.
